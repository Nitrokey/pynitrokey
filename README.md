# pynitrokey

A command line interface for the Nitrokey FIDO2, Nitrokey Start, Nitrokey Pro & NetHSM.

## Current state
Update to the latest firmware versions on the Nitrokey Start, Nitrokey FIDO2 and Pro v2 devices was tested. Windows support for Nitrokey Start is not added yet.

Additional features:
- handle `status` command for displaying touch button status (2.0.0 firmware and later);
- firmware signing adjusted for Nitrokey FIDO2 bootloader
- monitor command with timestamps

## Installation

### Linux, Unix

```bash
sudo apt install python3-pip
pip3 install --user pynitrokey
```

To access Nitrokey Start, Pro and FIDO2 devices without superuser rights, you need to install the Nitrokey udev rules that are shipped with `libnitrokey`.  You can also install them manually:

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nitrokey/libnitrokey/master/data/41-nitrokey.rules
sudo mv 41-nitrokey.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
```

### Windows
*Generally Windows support and the installer are experimental - please use with caution.*

Known issues:
* Support for Nitrokey Start under Windows 10 is not working without installing libusb libraries (to be described).
* The installer does not remove a previous installation (manually remove it using `settings -> programs and apps`)

How to install:
1. Download the latest `.msi` installer from [releases](https://github.com/Nitrokey/pynitrokey/releases/)
1. Double-click the installer and click through (`Next` and `Finish`)
1. Open the command console in the administrator mode (Windows 10: press the right mouse button on the Menu Start and select "Windows PowerShell (Admin)" from the menu).
1. Enter `nitropy`

Without administrator privileges `nitropy` might not be able to communicate to device.
